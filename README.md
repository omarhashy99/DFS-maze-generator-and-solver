# Redmi.mi - DFS Maze Generator and Solver

## Introduction

This project features a DFS maze generator and solver. To run the program, execute the '__init__.py' file. Each run of the program will result in the creation of a new maze.

## Usage

1. Run the '__init__.py' file.
2. A new maze will be generated.
3. Click on any blank point on the map.
4. The program will initiate the maze-solving process and move the turtle to the selected point.

## Overview

This application utilizes DFS (Depth-First Search) algorithms for both maze generation and solving. The DFS algorithm is employed to create a maze, and then it is applied again to navigate and solve the generated maze.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your needs.
